    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>What we have done:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Combinated the same threads(original posts and reply posts)</li>
<li>We used python to remove the punctations and some unrelated words(stopwords). The origal stopwords what we are using is <a href="http://zhuguanyu.github.io/fundamental_of_network/documents/stop_words_en.txt" style="color:blue">here</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Problems and New tasks:</h3>

<p>The stopwords are not enough. We should also remove the people names, places names, etc. So we summary the unrelated words to the following 9 categories.</p>

<ol>
<li>Spurious data.   2. Links. Then we ignored the url, website links and email links in the posts.</li>
<li>Punctuations and Numbers.     4. Traceroute measurements.      5. Stop words. We use a list of stop words obtained from the SMART information retrieval system.       6. Organization and Human names.</li>
<li>Time-related and Place-related words. Such as day, night, NYC, San Jose, etc.8. Some unrelated abbreviation words. Such like ICS, ISP, etc.     9. Others. This includes some entities words( like issue,information, etc) or phrase(like in order to)</li>

<li><p>Collate threads.  <br/>
We have contacted with the author of our reference paper, one of Phd students in our university, he shared with us some experience about this project and give us some guide, here we want to say thanks for him. We will classify these dataset at the level of threads.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove spurious data and stop-words
In this part, we will firstly try to learn some basic tools.
What&rsquo;s we need to learn: <em>SMART information retrieval system, Stanford CoreNLP toolkit, tf-idf</em>. After that, we need try to remove spurious data and stop-words(e.g., articles, prepositions and pronouns).</p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today We submitted <a href="http://zhuguanyu.github.io/fundamental_of_network/documents/proposal.pdf" style="color:blue">our proposal</a>. But we still had some problems about this project.</p>

<p>Questions about the real-time</p>

<ul>
<li>Outage mail is sent in real-time by someone?</li>
<li>If the outage is recovered right now, so what should I do for the diagnostic in this situation?</li>
<li>whatâ€™s the meaning of real-time.</li>
</ul>


<p>This project is based on this Paper <a href="http://zhuguanyu.github.io/fundamental_of_network/documents/PAM2015.pdf" style="color:blue">Internet Outages, the Eyewitness Accounts: Analysis of the Outages Mailing List</a>.</p>
